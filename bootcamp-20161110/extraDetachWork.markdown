This is an exercise from the (extras) part of the Tutorial [SURF Research Boot Camp 2016-11-10](.).

This exercise lets you experience the difference between local and remote computation: you can organize your work so that it continues after you close your laptop.

You will run a simple program that outputs a line each few seconds and experience what happens when you detach from the program in various ways.

## Set-up

- Create a new VM (you may be able to reuse the existing `images` and `templates` that you have created so far; but you can always import a new appliance from the AppMarket).
- Log into your VM using SSH.
- Let us now create a simple script file called `example.sh`. You can use your favourite editor. In our example we use nano, like this: 

```bash
cd
nano example.sh
```

- Write (or copy-and-paste) these lines into the file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
while sleep 2
do
  date
done
```

- Save the file and exit the editor. For example, in nano, you press `control-x` and then you press `Y` to confirm that you want to save your changes. Then you are back in the terminal.

- Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod u+x example.sh
```

- Run the script:

```bash
./example.sh
```

- After a while, terminate the script by typing `control-c`

## First detach

- Log in to you VM,
- run the example script:

```bash
./example.sh
```

- observe the output's progress
- log in with a second ssh session
- check with `ps` or `pstree` that your script runs,

```bash
pstree
# look for a line like this:
#  ... -example.sh---sleep
```

- disconnect the terminal with the running example by closing its window
- in the other session, use `ps` or `pstree` again to verify the the execution has stopped.

## Using `nohup`

- Log in to you VM,
- use `nohup` to run the example script in the background:

```bash
nohup ./example.sh &
```

The output will be:

```
nohup: ignoring input and appending output to ‘nohup.out’
```

- as before, check the process with `ps` or `pstree` and have a look at the progress:

```bash
tail -f nohup.out
```

- log out and log back in
- use `ps` or `pstree` to verify that your script is still running
- look at the output file(s) to see that output is still continuing

```bash
tail -f nohup.out
```

- kill the running script (as there is no natural end to it)

```bash
killall example.sh
```

- check the output file again to verify the script is no longer running
- remove the output file.

For more information read the manual, it is small and simple but effective. 

```
man nohup
```

## Using `screen`

You will use a program called `screen`. Similar programs are:  `tmux`, `dtach`+`dtvm`.

- start screen for the first time

```bash
screen
```

- after reading an initial message, you press the `Enter` key
- you see the normal shell prompt
- use `pstree` to see that you are actually in a screen session: look for a line similar to

```
├─sshd───sshd───sshd───bash───screen───screen───bash───pstree

```

- start your example script

```bash
./example.sh
```

- wait a few seconds and observe the output, as expected
- detach from the screen session by typing `control-a`, then `d`
- the view is restored to the situarion before you started `screen` and line says something similar to
 
``` 
[detached from 14691.pts-0.ip-145-100-58-55]
```

- wait several seconds and reconnect: use the `-r` flag

```
screen -r
```

- you see that the output has accumulated while you were detached, the script continued to run. 
- detach again (`control-a` plus `d`)
- log out and back in
- reconnect to the screen session
- find the script still running

- terminate the script (`control-c`)
- terminate the shell inside screen (`control-d`)
- you are back with the extra line `[screen is terminating]`
- try `screen -r`

## Multiple `screen` sessions

`screen` has a lot of confusing options. Try reading the manual page.

Examples:

### Start additional session

- in `screen`, type a command, so that you can recognize the session 
- type `control-a` `c` (lowercase C)
- you see a fresh screen with a new shell
- type a different command in the new shell
- type `control-a` `control-a` (yes, twice)
- you see the previous session
- type `control-a` `1` (digit one)
- you see the second session 
- type `control-a` `0` (digit zero)
- you see the first session again, sessions are numbered from zero
- add another session (`control-a` `c`, as before)

Play with these switching commands between the three sessions using `control-a` and a digit or the `control-a` `control-a` sequences

- type `control-a` `w` (lowercase W)
- during several seconds, a black bar at the bottom shows all sessions (windows) with their number.

### Split screen

- still in `screen`, type `control-a` `S` (capital S)
- the screen is now split into two panes with one the old session and the other blank
- switching session still works within the one pane, try it
- type `control-a` `TAB`
- the cursor moved to the blank pane
- switch one of your sessions
- experiment with switching between panes (`control-a` `TAB`) and between sessions in that pane
- combine with detaching from screen and re-attaching
