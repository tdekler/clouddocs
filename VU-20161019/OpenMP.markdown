This is an exercise from the [Extras](extras) part of the Tutorial [VU course 2016-10-19](.).

In this advanced part of our HPC Cloud tutorial we ask you to play around with a **parallel processing** technique on a **shared-memory** system. For this puspose, we will be running a Monte Carlo simulation to calculate an approximation of the value of _&pi;_. 

>**NOTE:**
>
>You are now in the advanced section of the workshop. You have your laptop and an Internet connection. We expect you will be able to find out more on your own about things that we hardly/don't explain but which you think you need. For example, if we were you, at this point we would've already googled for several things: 
>
>1. Monte Carlo simulation
>1. Monte Carlo pi
>1. OpenMP cheatsheet

We provide you with an implementation of that simulation using `OpenMP`. You will be asked to perform multiple runs of each program, so that fluctuations caused by e.g. network can be middled out. The output of each program includes results for run time in _wall-clock_, _user_ and _system_ time.

This exercise will let you use OpenMP, first with a serial implementation within a single multicore VM and then with diffrent parallel implementations. Please observe if the differences are significant or not for the scenarios below.

### a) Setting up a VM for the exercise

* On the UI, create a 2-core `template` that will use your existing **Course Image**:
  * On the _Templates_ tab (under _<i class="fa fa-cloud"></i> Virtual Resources_), click on the green _<i class="fa fa-plus" style="background-color:#43AC6A;border-color:#368a55;color:#fff;padding:1px 1ex 1px 1ex;"></i>_ button to create a new `template`
  * Edit the _<i class="fa fa-laptop"></i> General_ tab: type in a meaningful Name e.g. **OpenMP setup**, type in **2 CPUs** and **2 VCPUs**, type in **4GB Memory** 
  * Edit the _<i class="fa fa-tasks"></i> Storage_ tab: for the _Disk 0_, choose the **Course Image** (from the table on the right of the screen) 
  * Edit the _<i class="fa fa-globe"></i> Network_ tab: for the _NIC 0_, choose the _Internet network_.  
  * Edit the _<i class="fa fa-exchange"></i> Input/Output_ tab: click on the _VNC_ radiobutton
  * Finally, click on the green *Create* button at the top of the screen

* Launch a VM from that `template`

* Install the gcc compiler and gnu make:

```sh
sudo apt-get install build-essential 
```

> Optionally verify gcc and GNU make installation and version with `gcc -v` and  `make -v` respectively. 

* Download the [code file](code/gridpi-mp.tar) to your VM and uncompress the file:

```sh
wget http://doc.hpccloud.surfsara.nl/VU-20161019/code/gridpi-mp.tar 
tar -xvf gridpi-mp.tar 
```

* Inspect what files are in the example directory:

```sh
cd gridpi-mp/
ls -l 
```

### b) Serial runs

* The code in file **`gridpi-serial.c`** calculates _&pi;_ in a simple,
serial implementation. Have a look inside the file, e.g. `cat gridpi-serial.c`
* Compile the `gridpi-serial.c` program:

```sh
gcc -std=c99 -Wall -Werror -pedantic gridpi-serial.c -o gridpi-serial
```

* Run the serial program a few times:

```sh
./gridpi-serial
```

> * Do you see significant differences between *real* and *user* time? Can you explain?


### c) Simple OpenMP version

* The file **`gridpi-mp-simple.c`** is a first turn over `gridpi-simple.c` to use OpenMP.
* Have a look at the differences in the code.
* Compile the `gridpi-mp-simple.c` program:

```sh
gcc -std=c99 -Wall -Werror -pedantic -fopenmp gridpi-mp-simple.c -lm -o gridpi-mp-simple 
```

* Run a few times

```sh
./gridpi-mp-simple
```

> **_Food for brain c1:_**
>
> * How many threads are running?
> * Can you explain the differences in the code between this file and that of the previous exercise? In particular:
>   * What runs in parallel? What not?
>   * Which variables are used where?

### d) Running the OpenMP optimised version

* The file **`gridpi-mp-alt.c`** tries to optimise on `gridpi-mp-simple.c`
* Have a look at the differences in the code.
* Compile the `gridpi-mp-alt.c` program:

```sh
gcc -std=c99 -Wall -Werror -pedantic -fopenmp gridpi-mp-alt.c -lm -o gridpi-mp-alt
```

* Run a few times

```sh
./gridpi-mp-alt
```

> **_Food for brain d1:_**
>
> * How many threads are running?
> * Can you explain the differences in the code between this file and those of previous exercises b) and c)? In particular:
>   * What runs in parallel? What not?
>   * Which variables are used where?


### e) Running the OpenMP optimised alternative version

* The file **`gridpi-mp-reduction.c`** uses another approach to optimise on `gridpi-mp-simple.c`
* Have a look at the differences in the code.
* Compile the `gridpi-mp-reduction.c` program:

```sh
gcc -std=c99 -Wall -Werror -pedantic -fopenmp gridpi-mp-reduction.c -lm -o gridpi-mp-reduction
```

* Run a few times

```sh
./gridpi-mp-reduction
```

> **_Food for brain e1:_**
>
> * How many threads are running?
> * Can you explain the differences in the code between this file and those of previous exercises b), c) and d)? In particular:
>   * What runs in parallel? What not?
>   * Which variables are used where?

> **_Food for brain e2:_**
>
> Replace your VM with one that has more cores (hint: make a new `template` or update the current). Then run some batches of each of the exercises b), c), d) and e) again. 
>
> * How do times with more cores compare to those before? 
> * Does the performance scale for all of the implementations? Do you see any number where it ceases to make sense to scale? Can you explain?


### BONUS _food for brain_

This section is meant as extra questions that we thought would be nice for you to investigate, and we invite you to do/think about them even after the workshop is finished.

**Bonus1:** Make a batch of several runs (e.g.: 100) per exercise (b), c), d), e)) and calculate the *average runtime* and *standard deviation*. What do you observe? <br/> (hint: make a table where each row is each exercise, one column is the average time and one is the deviation you measured).    
**Bonus2:** Play around with the parameters in the source files (e.g. POINTS_ON_AXIS) <br/> (hint: add an extra column to the table for each parameter you change). Any insight?    
**Bonus3:** Can you draw some curves (graphs) with the measurements you have gathered? How do they compare?  
 

> **NOTE:**
> Do not forget to shutdown your VM when you are done with your performance tests.
