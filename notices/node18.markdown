# Compute node failure

We are currently experiencing a hardware failure on one of our compute nodes, all VM's that were running on this node are affected. This seems to be related to a raid (controller) failure, we are working hard to identify and restore the HPC Cloud to it's full capacity. Once we know the impact and source of this failure we will update this page.
