# User management

As a group administrator you can create users, change their passwords and set and change their quotas for number VM's running, CPU usage and memory usage. To do this, change your 'view' to the 'groupadmin' view. See the page on the [user interface](user-interface#switch-views) for more information on how to do this.

All user specific operations can be done from the _Users_ option of the _System_ section.

 * By clicking on the + icon in the large green box, you can add a user by specifying his/her username and password. You can also set the Autehntication and the group the user belongs to.

On the 'Users' page, all users if your project are visible, including you yourself. You can select the user to edit it. There are three main options:

 * _Quotas_ button: Clicking on this icon allows you to change the user quotas
 * _Password_ button: Clicking on this will let you change the password
 * One with a garbage bin on a red button. With this, you can delete the account.


To change the group membership of the users the _Groups_ option of the _System_ section is used.
