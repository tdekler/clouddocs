This is an exercise from the [Extras](extras) part of the Tutorial [UvA HPC course 2017-02-01](.).

In this advanced part of our HPC Cloud tutorial we ask you to play around with a **parallel processing** technique on a **message-passing** system. For this puspose, we will be running wave simulations using MPI. We will approximate solutions for the wave differential equation in 2D, by using numerical methods. 

>**NOTE:**
>
>You are now in the advanced section of the workshop. You have your laptop and an Internet connection. We expect you will be able to find out more on your own about things that we hardly/don't explain but which you think you need. For example, if we were you, at this point we would've already googled for several things: 
>
>1. Numerical methods
>1. Wave differential equation
>1. MPI cheatsheet

We provide you with an implementation of that simulation using `MPI`. You will be asked to perform multiple runs of each program, so that fluctuations caused by e.g. network can be middled out. 

>**Tip:**
>
>We recommend you have a look at the end of this page for some hints on how to help measuring time, running a program multiple times and computing an average time out of multiple measurements.

### a) Setting up a VM for the exercise

We will be creating a 2-core VM for this exercise.

* On the UI, import a new Ubuntu `App`:
  * On the _<i class="fa fa-cloud-download"></i> Apps_ tab (under _Storage_), import another copy of the **Ubuntu Desktop** `app`. Make sure you select the proper datastore for your new OS image (**123:local_images_Cursus**). Give the `image` and `template` the name: **mpi_wave**

* Edit the `image` to make it **persistent**.

* Edit the `template` to make it a 2-core one:
  * On the _Templates_ tab (under _<i class="fa fa-file-o"></i> VMs_), locate the **mpi_wave** `template` and click anywhere on its row (except the checkbox) to show its extended information. Then click the _Update_ button.
  * Edit the _<i class="fa fa-laptop"></i> General_ tab: type in **2 CPUs** and **2 VCPUs**, type in **4GB Memory** 
  * Check the _<i class="fa fa-tasks"></i> Storage_ tab: the _Disk 0_ must have the **mpi_wave** image selected (from the table on the right of the screen) 
  * Edit the _<i class="fa fa-globe"></i> Network_ tab: 
    * for the _NIC 0_, the _Internet network_ is selected
    * add a second `nic` (hit **+ Add another interface** button); for this second `nic`, _NIC 1_, choose the _uvacourse-surfsara.int_ network (from the table on the right of the screen)
  * Check the _<i class="fa fa-exchange"></i> Input/Output_ tab: 
    * the _VNC_ radiobutton must be selected
    * in the _Inputs_ section, select _Type_ **Tablet** and _Bus_ **USB**; then click the _Add_ button next to that
  * Finally, click on the green *Update* button at the top of the screen

* Launch a VM from that `template`

* Login to the VM with '-X' parameter to enable visualisation:

```sh
ssh -X ubuntu@145.100...`
```

* Install the gcc compiler and gnu make:

```sh
sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main universe"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential 
```

> Optionally verify gcc and GNU make installation and version with `gcc -v` and  `make -v` respectively. 

* Install other dependencies that our program requires:

```sh
sudo apt-get install libhdf5-serial-dev libopenmpi-dev openmpi-bin openmpi-common hdf5-tools ImageMagick gnuplot
```

<div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle fa-2x" aria-hidden="true">Warning</i><br>

The Ubuntu Desktop 14.04 _App_ is affected by the problem described in our documentation, [here](/connection_problem_ubuntu1404). To correct it easily, please follow these steps now that you are connected via SSH:

```sh
wget https://github.com/sara-nl/clouddocs/raw/gh-pages/UvA-20170201/code/cloudinit_fix.sh
chmod +x cloudinit_fix.sh
sudo ./cloudinit_fix.sh
```

</div>


### b) Preparing the program

* Download the [code file](code/waveeq.tar.gz) to your VM and uncompress the file:

```sh
wget https://github.com/sara-nl/clouddocs/raw/gh-pages/UvA-20170201/code/waveeq.tar.gz 
tar -zxf waveeq.tar.gz 
```

* Inspect what files are in the example directory:

```sh
cd waveeq/
ls -l 
```

* Compile the program:

```sh
make wave4
```

### c) Serial runs

The code in file **`wave4.c`** is where the main routine is. It uses functionality from other `.c` and `.h` files, but the main loop is there. The main loop understands how many MPI processes must be created and it divides the space among them to distribute work.

When the program runs, it writes output to file `wave4.h5` in [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/) format. 

* In the main routine you can find the main variables it uses:
  * `c` is the wave propagation speed
  * `zeta` is the damping coefficient
  * `m` and `n` are the spatial dimmensions; you can play with these to make a bigger/smaller surface
  * `nt` is the temporal dimmension; you can play with this to make a longer/shorter time simulation
  * `nt_i` is the _checkpoint_ interval: output will be written to file every so many `nt_i` time iterations. 

We invite you to explore the code to get familiar with it. If you change any of these values, please remember to compile the program again for the changes to make effect.

You can run the program in a single process with the following command:

```sh
time ./wave4
```

You can use the provided program `h5anim` to read from the output file of the `wave4` program (remember, called `wave4.h5`) and create an animated `wave4-anim.gif`. You do it so:

```sh
./h5anim wave4.h5 u
```

Then you can use any browser to view the animated gif (e.g. with the command `firefox wave4-anim.gif`), or install the program `gifview` (with `sudo apt-get install gifsicle`) and see it so: `gifview --animate wave4-anim.gif`.

> * Can you make a batch of several runs and observe the performance?

### d) Prepare for multi-VM

We will want to show how to **scale out** later, and that will involve multiple VMs, as explained during the presentation. In order for multiple VMs to be able to run out of the same `image`, this must be non-persistent (as explained in [Part B](partB)). 

* Let's prepare passwordless ssh among these VMs. For that, we will create a new SSH key-pair for user _ubuntu_ in these VMs, and add the public key to the list of authorised keys. Like this:

```sh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa  
#Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): <<<<leave this empty (hit enter twice)>>>>
cat /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> /home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Previously we made the `image` persistent so that when shutting the VM down, changes would be saved and kept for the next run. But changes are only saved when you actually shut the VM down gracefully. 

* Let's shut down the VM now **from the UI**, just as you learnt on [Part A](partA) (remember, the red dust-bin button).
  * Refesh the list of VMs (remember, the _<i class="fa fa-refresh"></i>_ icon) while you see your VM go through the different states: SHUTDOWN, EPILOG...
* Wait until the VM disappears
* Go to the _<i class="fa fa-download"></i> Images_ tab (under _Storage_), open the extended information for the **mpi_wave** `image` and switch the value for field _Persistent_ to **no**.

>**IMPORTANT**
>
>Now that the `image` is non-persistent, no changes will be saved when you shut down a VM using it. If you require so at some point, you will have to make it persistent again first!

### e) Multicore version

Because the program is ready for MPI, you can use `mpirun` to use multiple cores. 

**Exercse e1:** Try now the mpi run with 2 cores, like this:

* Start a new VM out of the **mpi_wave** `template`, giving it the name e.g.**mpi_wave_master**
* Login into the "mpi_wave_master" VM (emember to use the `-X` parameter for the `ssh` command)
* Go to the `waveeq` directory: `cd waveeq`

You can now run the program with 2 processes like:

```sh
time mpirun -n 2 ./wave4
```

> **_Food for brain e1:_**
>
> * Is the output image from this multi-process the same as the single-core one?
> * How many processes are running? (hint: use the `top` command on a different terminal)
> * Do you see any significant time improvement as compared to running it with one process? Can you explain the improvement (or lack thereof)?

**Exercise e2:** You can try to run now the program with more processes. For example, with 4:

```sh
time mpirun -n 4 ./wave4
```

> **_Food for brain e2:_**
>
> * Is the output image from this multi-process the same as that from previous runs?
> * Can you make a batch of several runs (e.g.: 20) and calculate the average runtime and standard deviation?
> * How many processes are running? (hint: use the `top` command on a different terminal)
> * Do you see any significant time improvement as compared to the previous runs? Can you explain the improvement (or lack thereof)?

**Exercise e3:** Try now running the program with a couple more configurations, like 6 processors or 8. Any improvement in time?

### f) Scaling out to multiple VMs 

MPI is able to communicate within processes that may physically by running on different (virtual) machines. We are going to make this happen now.

There is a fair amount of configuration that needs to happen among all the machines involved in cooperating for running MPI jobs. We have prepared a couple of scripts that you can use for that.

#### Master-workers concept

A typical way of considering a cluster is to have a **master** node (or host) where you can externally log into and launch the programs, along with a set of **worker** nodes that the master knows about and where it delegates computing workload.

In our exercises, we will consider one master and one worker node. Both will compute (so the master will not be just a passive node, but it will also contribute to the output). We will not consider any job-submitting queues, but rather, we will let MPI communicate over SSH. For that, both the master and the worker need to be able to SSH to each-other without requiring a password (a.k.a. **passwordless ssh**). We provide you with a script that you can run in each of the machines (in this case just one master an one worker) to do this interactively in a, hopefully, easy way.

To make it easier, all nodes where MPI will run a program must have that program installed the same way in the same path. Because we (you) have been carefully building the `image` so far, that is already arranged.

Also, usually the worker nodes are protected (inaccessible) from the outside world, so you can only reach them normally from within the internal network. We will simulate this as well. We have provided a script to configure the master and another for the worker node, which will change the hostname and also bring down the external network interface on the worker node.

#### Launch a 2-core worker VM
**Exercise f1:** Launch another VM that will become a worker

* On the UI, start another VM again out of the **mpi_wave** `template` with name e.g.**mpi_wave_worker**

#### Configure master and worker VMs

**Exercise f2:** Configure the **master** node

* Make sure you have an SSH connection to the VM we have been playing with so far (so, not the one you just created). This will become the master of our mpi cluster from now on.

* Write down the **internal** ip address of the master node.

* Run our configuration script to turn the "mpi_wave_master" VM into the master:

```sh
cd
wget https://github.com/sara-nl/clouddocs/raw/gh-pages/UvA-20170201/code/makeme_master.sh
chmod +x makeme_master.sh
sudo ./makeme_master.sh
exit
```

> **_Food for brain f2:_**
>
> * What has just happened?

**Exercise f3:** Configure the **worker** node

Let's start by giving `root` a password on the worker node, so that we can use the VNC console. 

* Login to the worker node "mpi_wave_worker" VM. Remember to use the `-X` parameter for the `ssh` command

* Run the commands to give a root password (type the passwords when you are asked to): 

```sh
sudo su -
passwd
exit
```

* Now open the VNC console on the UI for the worker node and log in as root. 

>**IMPORTANT!**
>
>* Do **not** go any further until you are sure that you can log in as root in the worker node via the VNC console. In the Desktop version select "Other" and enter "root" as username and the password you have just set. Ignore the error in initial screen (hit OK).

* Back in the SSH terminal you have for the worker as _ubuntu_ user run our configuration script to turn the VM into our mpi cluster's worker. To do this, type the commands:

```sh
cd
wget https://github.com/sara-nl/clouddocs/raw/gh-pages/UvA-20170201/code/makeme_worker.sh
chmod +x makeme_worker.sh
sudo ./makeme_worker.sh 1 XXX.YYY.ZZZ.TTT  #replace XXX.YYY.ZZZ.TTT with the INTERNAL IP address of the master
#hit ENTER when prompted and wait a bit..
```

> **_Food for brain f3:_**
>
> * Why do we recommend you to use the VNC console on this VM? 
> * What has just happened!? Why do you need to become root? Why does the script require those parameters?

#### Configuring the firewall

The _Apps_ that we deliverA come with a firewall running on the operating system, called UFW. MPI needs to communicate through the network between master and worker. They are both running a firewall. To avoid problems and because this is just a test scenario, we will trust all traffic coming from our internal interfaces.

* **On the master** VM, run the following commands: `sudo ufw allow in on eth1 && sudo service ufw restart`
* **On the worker** VM, run the same commands in a terminal in your VNC window: `sudo ufw allow in on eth1 && sudo service ufw restart` 

#### Launching a run over multiple VMs

**Exercise f4:** Run over 2 VMs

* **On the master**, make sure you are logged in as user _ubuntu_. Run our program with 4 processors over the 2 nodes (pay attention to the comma separating the master and the worker’s ip addresses):

```sh
time mpirun -np 4 -H <master_INTERNAL_ip>,<worker_INTERNAL_ip> /home/ubuntu/waveeq/wave4
```

> **_Food for brain f4:_**
>
> * Is the output image from this multi-process the same as that from previous runs?
> * How many processes are running? (hint: use the `top` command on different terminals)
> * Do you see any significant time improvement as compared to the previous runs? Can you explain the improvement (or lack thereof)?

### BONUS _food for brain_

This section is meant as extra questions that we thought would be nice for you to investigate, and we invite you to do/think about them even after the workshop is finished.

**Bonus 1:** Can you make a batch of several runs (e.g.: 20) and calculate the average runtime and standard deviation?

**Bonus 2:** What do you need to do to make more workers available? Is our image enough? Go ahead: try to have 2 more workers of 1 core each. Then run the program among them. Does the run time reduce? And if you have 2 workers, 2 cores each? And 3 workers, 2 cores each? And... Is it worth parallelising a lot? Where is the optimum?

**Bonus 3:** It can become a problem when you have to copy and install your program and data "everywhere" in the same place. This can be alleviated by sharing your `/home` folder via NFS. Can you set that up?

**Bonus 4:** Having to dowload, compile yourself the source code of the tool you need, and install it, is a very common workflow. Do you have a tool in this situation? Can it benefit from MPI? Please, let us know. Can you successfully get it running? Can you parallelise it?

**Bonus 5:** Using SSH might be a way to go along, but when you have multiple things to run at a time, ensuring users' access, passwordless permissions... There exist cluster-building tools based on job queues, like Sun (now Oracle) Grid Engine, Torque, etc. Can you find out more? Can you set it up?

**Bonus 6:** MPI is an implementation of a technique for parallelising computations. Another common technique is _shared memory_. One implementation for that technique is OpenMP. You can read more about it at their website: http://openmp.org/wp/. 

* Our program can also benefit from OpenMP. Does it make any sense to mix MPI and OpenMP? Are OpenMP-enabled MPI processes the same as MPI-enabled OpenMP programs?
* Can you make the program benefit from OpenMP at the same time as MPI?

### Time measurement hints

In order to help measuring times, we can give you the hints in this section.

* You can use the `time` facility from `bash` to measure the time it takes to run a command, like: `time command`. It will return 3 lines via stderr with: overall time and the subparts for user time and system time. 

* The plain format for the output of `time` is not very helpful for operating with the values; you can redefine it with the environment variable `TIMEFORMAT`. The value `%R` asks `time` to return the amount of seconds and milliseconds; that is much easier to operate with.

* Given a set of lines containing a number each, the following one-liner will compute the average and deviation, and print them in 2 lines: `awk '{sum += $1; sumsq+=$1*$1 } END {print "   avg " (sum/NR) "\nstddev " sqrt(sumsq/NR - (sum/NR) * (sum/NR))}'`. 
  * For example, if you have a file called `my_nums.txt` containing one number per line, you can compute average and standard deviation for those numbers like: `cat my_nums.txt | awk '{sum += $1; sumsq+=$1*$1 } END {print "   avg " (sum/NR) "\nstddev " sqrt(sumsq/NR - (sum/NR) * (sum/NR))}`

* You can run and measure a same command a given number of times by using a _for-loop_, like: `for run in {1..3}; do time COMMAND_HERE; done 2>&1`

* All together, an example for running a our `wave4` program 20 times with 2 processors and then compute the average running time, using an intermediate output-collection file (while, at the same time, showing progress on screen), could be:

```sh
TIMEFORMAT=$'elapsed %R' bash -c 'for i in {1..20}; do echo [iter $i]; time mpirun -n 2 ./wave4; done 2>&1 | tee times_n2.txt'

cat times_n2.txt | grep ^elapsed | sed -e s/.*\ // | awk '{sum += $1; sumsq+=$1*$1 } END {print "   avg " (sum/NR) "\nstddev " sqrt(sumsq/NR - (sum/NR) * (sum/NR))}'
```

An explanation on the previous code listing:

* The first line runs the command in a loop and takes all output into the `times_n2.txt` file. Every iteration, the `time` command outputs a line like `elapsed ...`.

* The second line reads the `times_n2.txt` file; it filters all lines to take only those that start with `elapsed`. For each of these lines, `sed` takes only the number after the space. Finally, `awk` processes all these numbers and, when it is done, it prints out the average and standard deviation.
