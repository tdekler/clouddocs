These are the extras of the Tutorial [UvA HPC course 2017-02-01](.).

**You should have completed (and understood)** [Part A](partA) and [Part B](partB), before trying these extras.

The exercises below can be done in any order and you can do as far as you want, depending on your enthusiasm and available time.

You will find several _Food for brain_ questions in each exercise about situations that you might encounter when working with **Parallel programming** techniques. We advice that you perform many tests, observe the results (write down execution times, change parameters, make tables, draw graphs...), and think about your answers.

## OpenMP

Link: [OpenMP: calculating _&pi;_](OpenMP)
  
  Using a simple algorithm to calculate _&pi;_ as an example, you see the impact of the **scale-up** model and parallel programming with OpenMP.

## MPI

Link: [MPI: Wave equation](MPI)

  Using a numerical method to calculate wave propagation as an example, you see the impact of both **scale-up** and **scale-out** models and parallel programming with MPI.
  
## XML-RPC

Link: [XML-RPC](XMLRPC)
  
  Experiencing the automation API that OpenNebula provides, which can be used to find out a lot of information about your own environment, and to operate with VMs in a non-interactive way.
